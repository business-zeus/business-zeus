## what do i know
### languages
- **Java** - from basic OOP to specific APIs like JPA: School has taught me.
- **Python** - for my amateur projects several years ago, such as Discord bots and pygame games. Also comes in useful for data science stuff like pandas and seaborn or AI libraries like sklearn and pytorch.
- **C#** - what I know about it is all thanks to Unity.
- **Javascript/TypeScript** - I have used raw JS with HTML websites while learning web design basics, though I prefer to use TypeScript when it comes to the more complex stuff.
- **Dart** - after using this language in Flutter projects for one school year, I have grown to appreciate it.
- **HTML** - this one's common knowledge, even for some non-IT-people, right?
- **SQL** - SQL Server, MariaDB, Postgres. My knowledge also includes things about the background process/technology of databases, not just querying.

### frameworks 'n other stuff
- **Angular** - this one's my favorite Frontend-wise.
- **ExpressJS** - this one's my area of expertise Backend-wise.
- **Flask** - this one's something I taught myself instead of learning it in school.
- **Flutter** - while I prefer using Browser-only technologies with HTML, I appreciate Flutter for it's compatibility.
- **Unity** - my knowledge with Unity is rather surface-level, but enough to be mentioned here.
